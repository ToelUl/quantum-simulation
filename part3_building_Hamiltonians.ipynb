    "# Tutorial: Building Quantum Hamiltonians with the `quantum_simulation` Toolkit\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this tutorial\\! The goal of this guide is to walk you through the process of constructing Hamiltonian matrices for various quantum systems using the powerful and flexible `quantum_simulation` toolkit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The library is built on a few core principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Modularity:** Operator definitions, the Hamiltonian builder, and pre-built physical models are separated into distinct modules (`operator`, `hamiltonian`, `models`).\n",
    "  * **Package Structure:** All modules are part of a unified `quantum_simulation` package, allowing for clean and organized imports.\n",
    "  * **Flexibility:** The `Hamiltonian` class acts as a universal builder, allowing you to add different types of terms (spin, boson, fermion) to construct the matrix for nearly any lattice model.\n",
    "  * **Ease of Use:** For common systems, the `models` module provides ready-to-use classes that handle the construction for you and can even display a symbolic representation of the Hamiltonian.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Setting up the `quantum_simulation` package** in Colab.\n",
    "2.  **Understanding the core components** of the toolkit.\n",
    "3.  **Building a spin model from scratch** (the Transverse Field Ising Model).\n",
    "4.  **Building a fermionic model from scratch** (the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Model).\n",
    "5.  **Exploring the pre-built `models` module** and its catalog of Hamiltonians.\n",
    "6.  **Using the `add_prebuilt_term`** for special cases."

    "## 7\\. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations\\! You have now learned how to use the `quantum_simulation` toolkit to construct Hamiltonians for arbitrary lattice models.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have learned to:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Build from scratch:** Use the `Hamiltonian` class with `add_spin_term` and `add_fermion_term` for full, low-level control.\n",
    "  * **Use convenience classes:** Leverage the `models` module to quickly generate Hamiltonians for common physical systems and to visualize their mathematical formulas.\n",
    "  * **Handle special cases:** Inject pre-calculated matrices directly into the builder when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This flexible, multi-layered design allows for both rapid prototyping of standard models and detailed construction of novel, complex Hamiltonians. Happy simulating\\!"
